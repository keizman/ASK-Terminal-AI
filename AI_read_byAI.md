# ASK Terminal AI - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
ASK Terminal AI is a command-line tool that integrates with various AI provider APIs to offer two primary modes:

1. **Virtual Terminal Mode** - Provides command suggestions and execution capabilities
2. **Conversation Mode** - Enables direct interaction with AI assistants

This implementation plan focuses on delivering the chat/completions API core functionality based on the existing codebase structure and requirements.

## Project Structure

Provider Adapters
While you have basic OpenAI adapter implemented, you'll need to:

Complete adapter_factory.go to properly route requests to the correct adapter based on config
Add comprehensive error handling in openai_adapter.go
Consider future support for other providers (marked as planned in docs)
2. Logging System
Need to implement:

Command history logging to /tmp/askta_Chistory.log
Application logging in /tmp/askta_run.log
Support for -show option in root.go to display recent command history
3. Terminal UI Enhancements
Improve existing implementations in the terminal package:

Enhance command selection and editing in command_mode.go
Add progress indicators during API calls
Better error handling/display
4. Privacy Features
Implement private_mode flag logic in prompt.go to control what environmental data is sent
Add contextual information control
5. Command Execution
Complete command execution from Virtual Terminal mode in command_mode.go
Add command execution feedback
6. Stream Processing
Implement stream handling for responses
